In the early years of the work of the Office, the reporters didn’t cover as much territory as it does today which is why the network is smaller, but not necessarily because there weren't other groups recruiting. What we want to show here is that there is a remarkable evolution of the network. 

The last period's network has more nodes and connections that cover the 5 actors identified, and all the departments in Colombia. Not only do the traditional strategies remain a common practice (forced recruitment, pressure, instigation to drug consumption, but there are lowkey strategies that also become, according to our data, more frequent, silent and manipulative such as "Gifts, Promises, Handouts”. Armed groups will offer money, drugs, protection, guns, false job offers, the promise of recognition or an increase of social status among their peers, financial aid to families, privileges, and a salary, among others.

This type of strategy is observed to increase in those early warnings where Localized Armed Groups are identified. Although it is used by others too, there is a pattern of slowly but continuos increasing pattern of use of this strategy by Local Armed Groups with respect to others. Minors will start with tasks as a messenger, drug transporter or even dealer, and become combatants and members of the groups. These dynamics are used for the groups to gain presence in urban areas, small and big cities where they start to interact with Police and institutions, granting them access to a different kind of influence over public policy decisions at the different levels without the need to physically control the territory as guerrillas attempted to in the second half of the 20th Century.
